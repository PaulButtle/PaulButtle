# 👋 Hello there

I'm a curious human who designs things, builds things, and breaks things (on purpose).  
Passionate about creating tools people actually *want* to use — with a soft spot for elegant UIs, intelligent systems, and the occasional side quest into game design.

## 🛠️ Current projects
- 🎮 Building a Scrabble-style multiplayer game (React + ShadCN + a sprinkle of chaos)
- 📚 Working on a game discovery app for gamers who don't like wasting time
- 🤖 Exploring how AI can help humans do less admin and more meaningful work

## 🧠 Philosophy
Design like a storyteller. Code like a craftsman. Learn like a kid with a box of Lego.

## 💡 Interests
- Interaction design
- Videography experiments
- Indie games
- Tiny AI helpers
- Good documentation (yes, really)

> Always shipping. Occasionally sleeping.
